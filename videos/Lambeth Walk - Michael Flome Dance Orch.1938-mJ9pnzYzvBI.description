Michael Flome -- Lambeth Walk (Noel Gay), Brunswick 1938
---------------------------------------------------------
After 1938 premiere of Noel Gay's musical „Me And My Girl" (originally: „Me And My Gal") in London, the dance of Lambeth Walk immediately became  the third great Dance Craze of inter-war Europe. After the tango (in 1920s), then in 1925 -- the charleston, followed by its clon, a black bottom and - in 1930s rhumba (also having „carioca" as her twin-sister) -- the awesome, metropolitan dance called „the lambeth walk" -- originating from South London's suburb (Lambeth Walk is across the Thames, diagonally southeast from the British House of Parliament)-- swept across Europe and both Americas only a couple of months before the onset of  WWII. 
The artists say, the Old World in 1939 was „entering its Great Collapse to the rhythm of Lambeth Walk".
